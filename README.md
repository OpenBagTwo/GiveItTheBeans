# Give It The Beans!

This datapack allows you to give Happy Ghasts a much needed speed boost by
"feeding" them snowballs

## How to Use

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/GiveItTheBeans/releases),
and save it to your world's "datapacks" folder.

Once installed, grab a few stacks of snowballs, and hop on a Happy Ghast. Every
five seconds, the datapack will check if you're holding a snowball. If you are,
then one snowball will be deducted from your hand and "fed" to the happy ghast,
applying a speed bost for the next five seconds.

### Uninstalling

To uninstall the datapack, simply remove it from your world.

To be extra safe, you can also run the command:
```mcfunction
/function gitb:reset
```
from the ground / without any snowballs in your hand to make extra special sure
you've reset the Happy Bois' speed attributes.

## Compatibility

This datapack has been tested on versions:

- [x] 1.21.6
